# Random Python
<h3>Welcome to random code</h3>

This repository will be used for small pieces of code, for temporary tasks, usually from computer science
Currently contains:
 - Function to convert hexadecimal to denary
 - The good 'ol FizzBuzz game
 - Video downloading script

(More will be added in the future)


<h4>Hex to denary function:</h4>
 - Will let you input a hex number (eg. 2A)
 - Uses a dictionary and x16 multiplication to output the denary digit

<h4>FizzBuzz:</h4>
 - Come on, who doesn't know what this does...
 - But well, *sigh* here we go again
 - It will output all the digits, from 1 to the inputted one
      - If the current digit is a multiple of 3, it will print out Fizz
      - If the current digit is a multiple of 5, it will print out Buzz
      - If the current digit is a mutiple of both, 3 and 5, it will print out FizzBuzz
      - If the current digit is a multiple of none of those, it just prints it normally

<h4>Video downloading script:</h4>
 - In a text file, on one line, you put the link to the video, and the title that you want it to be saved as after a semi-colon and space(; )
 - Script parses line by line and downloads each link, with the link and title
 - Uses youtube-dl and os module for the terminal
